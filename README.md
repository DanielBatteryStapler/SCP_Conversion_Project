The SCP Conversion Project, which so-far only has one member, is dedicated to converting and providing the SCP Wiki (http://www.scp-wiki.net/) in different formats, which currently consist of PDF and a simplified version of the original HTML. This project has the secondary goal of preparing for the event that Wikidot is lost by archiving all of the original article source-code and images and providing tools that can be used to convert what the authors have written into what the readers see without relying on Wikidot or any Wikidot code so that writting can continue even with the loss of Wikidot.
