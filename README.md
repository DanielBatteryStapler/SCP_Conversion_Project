# SCP Conversion Project

This project is focused on creating a free, open-source reimplementation of the SCP Wiki. Documentation about the programming is a little scarce at the moment, but more can be found on the [website](https://scp.karagory.com/) and I am always open for question on the project's [discord server](https://discord.gg/7GjqMJj).
