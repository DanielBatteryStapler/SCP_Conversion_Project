# The "nextgen" Branch

This branch is focused on reorganizing the SCP Conversion Project to take the form of a read-only reimplementation of the current scp-wiki.net. It will support: all pages, page revision history, the entire forum, and overall better support for page formatting. Basically, for the average reader, it will appear similiar to the current scp-wiki.net with minimal differences. PDF support will continue being a priority and will be built directly into the website.

The reimplementation will also allow experiments into adding long-awaited features that the current hosting, WikiDot, does not support (e.g. having page previews when hovering over links). And, of course, the long time goal of this project is to provide tools for the SCP wiki to live on even in the event that WikiDot goes down, and to pave the way for an eventual migration off of WikiDot.

Development for this branch is in its early stages, but is active.
